#Ski Resort

The aim is to develop an application allowing to help clients of the ski resort to traverse the area. The needed information on the ski resort are stored in a file named *dataski.txt*.<br>
Implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm) in order to help clients to reach a point from an other in the fastest way.<br>
Allow clients to chose routes to do depending on their skiing level and their will (maybe, they do not want to take a special route) and display all reachable points from where they are thanks to the possible routes.

For further information, please read *Subject.pdf* file.
